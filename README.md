## Summary
This program will do the Collatz Conjecture. It takes a integer input and finds the number of steps to reach one using the following algorithm:
* If n is even, divide it by 2.
* If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The `Collatz Conjecture` is also known as the `3n + 1 conjecture` and the numbers of the sequence are refered to as hailstone numbers.
More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

## Instructions
* Use the given make file.
* Alternatively, compile: `$ javac CollatzConjecture.java`
* Run: `$ java CollatzConjecture`
